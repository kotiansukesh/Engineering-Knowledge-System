## Intent

With multiple copies of the same data, we are faced with options on how to synchronize them so clients have a consistent view of the data. Recall the definition of consistency from the CAP theorem - Every read receives the most recent write or an error.

## Why it Matters

- **Interview signal**: CAP theorem is the #1 distributed systems question
- **Production impact**: Every distributed database decision is a CP vs AP choice
- **Core concept**: You cannot have all three - networks WILL partition

With multiple copies of the same data, we are faced with options on how to synchronize them so clients have a consistent view of the data. Recall the definition of consistency from the CAP theorem - Every read receives the most recent write or an error.



After a write, reads may or may not see it. A best effort approach is taken.

This approach is seen in systems such as memcached. Weak consistency works well in real time use cases such as VoIP, video chat, and realtime multiplayer games. For example, if you are on a phone call and lose reception for a few seconds, when you regain connection you do not hear what was spoken during connection loss.

### Eventual consistency

After a write, reads will eventually see it (typically within milliseconds). Data is replicated asynchronously.

This approach is seen in systems such as DNS and email. Eventual consistency works well in highly available systems.

### Strong consistency

After a write, reads will see it. Data is replicated synchronously.

This approach is seen in file systems and RDBMSes. Strong consistency works well in systems that need transactions.

## Problems

### System Design Problem: Consistency Patterns

**Requirements:**
- See primer for detailed requirements

**Constraints:**
- High availability, scalability, fault tolerance

## Code / Example

```java
// Java 25 / Spring Boot 3.5: Core concept for Consistency Patterns
// Architecture pattern - implementation varies by system

record ConsistencyPatternsConfig(
    String component,
    int capacity,
    String strategy
) {
    static ConsistencyPatternsConfig ofDefaults() {
        return new ConsistencyPatternsConfig(
            "Consistency Patterns",
            10000,
            "default"
        );
    }
}
```

### Concrete Example
- **Input:** Design requirements
- **Output:** Architecture diagram + component specs
- **Explanation:** See primer for step-by-step design

## When to Use / When NOT

| **Use When** | **Avoid When** |
|--------------|----------------|
| Building this system from scratch | Managed service covers need |
| Learning architecture patterns | Simple CRUD applications |
| Interview preparation | Requirements don't match |

## Trade-offs

| Dimension | This Approach | Alternative |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Complexity | | |
| Operational Burden | | |
| Latency | | |
| Consistency | | |
| Cost at Scale | | |

## Vs Table

| Aspect | This Design | Managed Service | Decision Rule |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Flexibility | Full | Limited | Need custom logic? → Self-host |
| Time to Market | Weeks | Hours | Prototype? → Managed |
| Cost at Scale | Optimizable | Fixed/marginal | High volume? → Self-host |

## Pitfalls

- Underestimating operational complexity
- Ignoring failure modes
- Not planning for 10x scale
- Skipping monitoring/alerting in MVP
- Premature optimization before measuring

## Interview Q&A (Senior Depth)

**Q1: Walk me through the high-level architecture for Consistency Patterns.**
**A:** [Key components, data flow, boundaries. Use back-of-envelope to justify scale.]

**Q2: What are the key trade-offs in this design?**
**A:** [CAP, Latency vs Throughput, Build vs Buy, SQL vs NoSQL, Sync vs Async. Cite specific choices.]

**Q3: How does this scale to 10x traffic?**
**A:** [Stateless services, sharding, read replicas, caching layers, async processing via message queues. Identify bottlenecks.]

**Q4: What happens when [critical component] fails?**
**A:** [Retries, circuit breakers, fallback, graceful degradation, data recovery, replay.]

**Q5: How do you monitor and debug this in production?**
**A:** [RED metrics: rate, errors, duration. USE metrics: utilization, saturation, errors. Structured logging, correlation IDs. SLO-based alerting.]
